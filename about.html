            Sometimes I think I was meant to live underwater! I’m much more
            graceful there. On land, my feet always seem to find something to
            trip on. Have you ever seen a mermaid trip? Of course not, because
            they don’t have feet, so they can’t trip or fall. It’s a fact …
            really!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            For as long as I can remember, I have loved the ocean. Sitting near
            it, walking along it, swimming it … and, to me, there is nothing
            better than SCUBA diving in it. A lot of divers love the warm, clear
            tropical waters. Don’t get me wrong … I love those too. However … my
            lifestyle and my budget has meant that 99% of my diving is done
            right here in New England, simply walking off of our shores. And I
            love it!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If New England diving is my greatest passion, my 2nd greatest
            passion would be sharing my love of our ocean with others and
            helping others to enjoy it. I first learned to dive outside of
            Boston. It was something I’d dreamed of doing for years, and I
            finally took the plunge, literally. My first time in the pool, I
            panicked. My instructor (who no longer teaches) told me I wasn’t cut
            out for this. Never, never let anybody tell you that you are not cut
            out to do something that you want to do. I never panicked again, and
            I had found my new favorite thing. Within a few years, I was
            certified as a dive professional by PADI (Professional Association
            of Dive Instructors), and a couple years ago I received my “25 Years
            of Service” honor from them. Nothing makes me happier when I am
            teaching than to help somebody succeed, especially those students
            who are not sure that they can do this – because they can!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I also love to teach people, divers and non-divers alike, about the
            oceans and the wonderful creatures that inhabit our New England
            waters. I can talk about this non-stop, so it’s best for me to have
            an audience that actually signed up to learn about this.
          </p>
          <br />

            I wanted to start to take my own underwater pictures to use during
            my classes and to share with my friends, so my husband bought me an
            underwater camera set for my 50th birthday. I won’t tell you how
            many years ago that was. I have not yet embraced the technical
            aspects of underwater photography. If somebody asked me about my
            camera settings, I would likely respond “on.” We don’t need to be
            amazing photographers to capture images to share with our friends or
            to have for ourselves, or to even post in a blog! Of course I hope
            to continue to improve my underwater photography, but the process of
            taking the photograph will always be secondary to enjoying the
            experience that I am having underwater.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            What do I do on land? I live in Connecticut with my wonderful
            husband Steve. Yes, he dives too, and that is how we met. One of our
            wedding songs was “Under the Sea” from the Little Mermaid. We have
            raised an incredible son and are now empty-nesters. People warned me
            that would happen if we raised him right. Steve and I own a bicycle
            shop having left our former careers after many years/decades. I
            enjoy almost anything outdoors – hiking, kayaking, bicycling. I am
            not an extreme sports person on land. As I mentioned earlier, my
            tendency towards on-land clumsiness would not be a great match for
            such activities.
          </p>

            One final thing that you should know about New England mermaids. New
            England mermaids do not always look glamorous. We have to wear
            bulkier insulation and be more practical than our tropical
            relatives. It’s okay though. The visibility is usually poor enough
            that nobody is really watching us anyways.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So let’s head to the shore, dive in and have some fun! Thanks for
            joining me!
